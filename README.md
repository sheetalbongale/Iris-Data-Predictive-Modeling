# Iris-Data-Predictive-Modelling

Build and test multiple sci-kit learn machine learning models to predict species from flower measurements.

### Technologies and Libraries
Following s a list of the Python SciPy libraries used for this project:
```
- sklearn
- scipy
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas
```

### Machine Learning Algorithms
I explored the following 6 different algorithms from sci-kit learn:

- Logistic Regression (LR)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- Classification and Regression Trees (CART).
- Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB).
- Support Vector Machines (SVM).

This is a good mixture of simple linear (LR and LDA), nonlinear (KNN, CART, NB and SVM) algorithms.

### Conclusion:
It looks like Support Vector Machines (SVM) has the largest estimated accuracy score at about 0.98 or 98%.
