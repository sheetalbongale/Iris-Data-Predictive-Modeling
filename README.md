# Basic Predictive Modeling on Iris Data-set

![iris-image](img/iris-species.png)

Build and test multiple sci-kit learn machine learning models to predict species from flower measurements.

## Data-Set
The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other. 

Predicted attribute: class of iris plant. 
This is an exceedingly simple domain.

**Attribute Information:**

1. sepal length in cm 
2. sepal width in cm 
3. petal length in cm 
4. petal width in cm 
5. Species class: 
- Iris Setosa 
- Iris Versicolour 
- Iris Virginica

## Technologies and Libraries
Following is a list of the Python libraries used for this project:
```
- sklearn
- scipy
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas
```

## Machine Learning Algorithms
I explored the following 7 different algorithms from sci-kit learn:

- Logistic Regression (LR)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- Classification and Regression Trees (CART).
- Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB).
- Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- Gradient Boosting Classifier(GB).

This is a good mixture of simple linear (LR and LDA), nonlinear (KNN, CART, NB and SVM) algorithms.

## Conclusion:
It looks like Support Vector Machines (SVM) has the largest estimated accuracy score at about 0.98 or 98%.
